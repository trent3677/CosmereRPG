      "description": "A lean, alert human rogue in worn leather armor, constantly scanning for threats. The figure has sharp, hawkish features with keen eyes that miss nothing. Wears a hooded cloak in forest colors for camouflage, with the hood partially drawn. Light leather armor reinforced with metal studs at vital points allows for quick movement. A well-used shortbow is held ready with an arrow nocked but not drawn. A quiver of arrows hangs at the hip alongside a short sword. Their stance shows readiness to either shoot or sound an alarm horn hanging from their belt. Face paint in dark patterns helps break up their features for better concealment. Several small pouches and tools for setting simple alarms and traps hang from their belt. They stand on elevated ground or a wooden watchtower platform, eyes constantly moving, embodying the perfect lookout. The background shows a forest path they're watching. Photorealistic detail capturing the alert tension and readiness, with careful attention to the weathered equipment and camouflage elements, dramatic forest lighting.",

PHYSICAL APPEARANCE: Gorvek is a massive, muscular HALF-ORC male in his early 40s, standing 6'5\" tall with a powerful, intimidating build. His skin is a grayish-green tone typical of half-orcs. His face bears multiple battle scars, including a prominent scar running from his left eyebrow down across his eye (which is milky white and blind) to his jaw. His good right eye burns with an UNNATURAL GREEN LIGHT (corrupted by dark magic) and cunning intelligence. He has prominent lower tusks jutting from his jaw, filed to sharp points. His black hair is pulled back in a warrior's topknot, with the sides of his head shaved and tattooed with tribal orcish war patterns. A thick black beard is braided with small bone trophies. ARMOR AND EQUIPMENT: He wears piecemeal plate armor - a mix of stolen knight's armor pieces and reinforced leather, all painted black and adorned with spikes and fur pelts. The chest plate bears the symbol of a blood-red axe crossed with a thorn branch. His massive shoulders are protected by spiked pauldrons made from bear skulls. A tattered crimson cloak made from the banners of defeated enemies hangs from his shoulders. WEAPONS: In his right hand, he wields a massive two-handed battle axe with a wickedly curved blade that gleams with a dark red tint (from dried blood). The axe handle is wrapped in leather and studded with iron. A heavy crossbow hangs on his back, and multiple daggers are visible sheathed across his chest. A coiled whip hangs from his belt. POSE AND SETTING: Gorvek stands on a raised wooden platform in his forest stronghold, one foot planted on a chest overflowing with stolen gold. Behind him, bandit banners hang from rough wooden walls. He's captured mid-battle cry, mouth open showing filed teeth, raising his battle axe overhead with both hands. His pose radiates dominance and savage leadership. The lighting is dramatic - firelight from torches casts harsh shadows across his scarred HALF-ORC face and armor. His corrupted eye glows with an eerie green light while his tusks gleam menacingly. The overall impression is of a dangerous, cunning half-orc warlord who has been touched by dark magic and commands through violence and supernatural intimidation.",

Sharp thorns protrude menacingly from its sinewy appendages, glistening with a viscous sap that emits a faint, acrid odor. The creature's body is intertwined with decayed leaves and remnants of small animals, absorbed into its being, giving it an unsettlingly organic texture. Lacking a distinct face, it bears a gaping maw at its center, lined with jagged, leaf-like teeth, which drips with the same toxic fluid that seeps from its thorns.\n\nBeneath the canopy of the ancient oaks, the Corrupted Vine Blight thrives in the shadows, its movements slow and deliberate as it waits for prey. It emits a low, rustling sound, akin to whispers carried on the wind, drawing in unsuspecting travelers with promises of shelter from the oppressive gloom. When provoked, it lashes out violently, ensnaring foes in a vice-like grip of vines, seeking to drain their vitality and leave them as another offering to the dark forces inhabiting Gloamwood. The air around it is heavy with an unnatural chill, and the faint glow of ethereal blue witchlights flickers sporadically, illuminating its grotesque form as if the forest itself is warning intruders of the lurking menace.",

Its form is ethereal, a swirling mass of smoky tendrils that flicker with a faint, eerie glow reminiscent of dying flames. The wraith's visage is obscured, yet within the depths of its shadowy hood, two ember-like eyes burn with a smoldering intensity, glimmering with an insatiable hunger for the warmth of the living. The air around it is choked with the acrid scent of burnt salt and the haunting echoes of lost souls, mingling with the briny tang of the sea. As it drifts silently through the crumbling ruins of the abbey, the Black Ember Wraith embodies the sorrow of the forsaken, weaving between broken pews and shattered mosaics, its presence chilling the very air. When provoked, it unleashes a whispering wail that reverberates through the salt-bitten stone, a mournful sound that speaks of despair and vengeance. Those drawn too close find themselves ensnared in its grasp, feeling their life force flicker like a candle caught in the wind, as the wraith seeks to reclaim the warmth it has lost to the depths of the sea.",
