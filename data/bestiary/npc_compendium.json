His hollow, glowing eyes hold a cold regal wisdom beneath a corroded crown entwined with coral and kelp. He wears tattered, salt-stained royal robes layered with rusted chainmail and corroded ceremonial armor, adorned with motifs of crashing waves and drowned shipwrecks. A weathered, ceremonial trident rests sheathed at his side, its shaft encrusted with barnacles and etched with eldritch runes. He stands solemnly within the flooded Sunken Monarch's Court of the drowned catacombs, shadowed by broken salt-crusted columns and flickering phosphorescent lichen, with swirling brine pooling around his ancient throne. The chamber is suffused with a spectral, eerie blue-green glow emanating from bioluminescent lichen and his own arcane aura, while mist drifts languidly through the stale, salt-thickened air. The atmosphere is one of haunting melancholy mixed with cold authority, captured under cinematic, ethereal lighting that casts deep shadows and highlights the tragic majesty of this once-mighty ruler bound beneath the waves.",
