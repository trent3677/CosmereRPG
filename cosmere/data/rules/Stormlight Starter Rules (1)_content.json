Each role follows\ndifferent rules:\nMinion adversaries are weaker than other adversaries.\nEach has the Minion feature: “The minion’s attacks\ncan’t critically hit, and they’re immediately defeated\nwhen they suffer an injury.”\nRival adversaries have no additional rules and present\na standard challenge to adventurers.\nBoss adversaries can challenge an entire party. They’re\nmore threatening—and more complex to run—than\nother adversaries. Each has the Boss feature: “The\nboss can take both a fast turn and a slow turn each\nround. After an enemy finishes a turn, the boss can\nspend 1 focus to immediately use an extra or\n. Additionally, they can spend 1 focus on their turn\nto remove a condition from themself.”\nIf you’re planning combat encounters of your own\nmaking, be aware that each role presents a dramatically\ndifferent level of threat.\n56 Part 7: Gamemastering",
