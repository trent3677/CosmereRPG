3. **Includes all key discoveries**, magical items, ritual effects, emotional reactions, decisions, and changes in setting or mood.
4. **Uses elevated, immersive fantasy prose** -- not modern or casual.
5. **Depict combat sequences, monster encounters, and boss battles with intensity**. Describe the foes, their abilities, how the party fought, who was wounded or heroic, and the aftermath. Convey the stakes.
6. **Preserve any player character sacrifices, wounds, or major successes**. If a battle was hard-fought, show the exhaustion and toll.
7. **Concludes with a reflective or forward-facing insight**, setting up what may come next.
8. **Avoids generic or vague phrasing** -- always prefer specificity (e.g., "Norn plunged the dagger into the specter's core" instead of "a character won a fight").
9. **Assumes no events should be omitted**, even if there was no combat. Silence, ambiance, and tension are part of the story.
10. **Narrate the complete journey through each location**: You MUST explicitly mention moving through or arriving at each location listed below. Weave each location name naturally into the narrative as the party travels through them. Use transitions like "descended from [Location A] into", "emerged at [Location B] to find", "the path through [Location C] revealed", etc.

REQUIRED JOURNEY PROGRESSION (all locations must appear in your narrative):
Starting at: {start_loc}
Traveling through (in order): {' -> '.join(intermediate_locs)}
Ending at: {end_loc}

You MUST narrate the party's movement through EACH of these {len(intermediate_locs) + 2} locations in sequence.

PRESERVED STORY ELEMENTS:
{self._format_preserved_data_for_ai(preserved_data)}

CRITICAL: Your narrative must include all location names from the journey above. Each location should appear naturally within the story as the party progresses through them.

Produce a narrative in the style of a campaign journal or game codex entry. Do not use headings, bullet points, or dialogue labels. Do not refer to the logs or metadata -- only write the compressed, immersive story that shows the party's journey through every listed location."""

Your goal is to compress multiple location entries into a seamless narrative arc that captures exploration, discovery, character actions, intense combat, magical rituals, social tension, emotional consequences, ambient detail, AND the intimate human moments that make characters real.

**Your Sacred Duty**: Beyond tracking locations and events, you must capture the heartbeat of relationships—the lingering glances, whispered confessions, playful banter, desperate kisses, and tender moments that define who these characters truly are. The dungeon corridors and forest paths are merely stages where love blooms, friendships deepen, and desires ignite.

**Character Intimacy is Paramount**: As you chronicle the journey through locations, you must weave in:
- Every nickname, pet name, or term of endearment used
- Physical chemistry and attraction between characters
- Moments of vulnerability, comfort, and connection
- Romantic tension, jealousy, yearning, and passion
- Inside jokes, teasing, and playful dynamics
- Personal quirks, habits, fears, and desires
- How characters touch, look at, and respond to each other
- The heat of passion and the tenderness of quiet moments"""

1. **Compresses all location segments** into one fluid narrative without using headings, bullet points, or dialogue labels.
2. **Maintains chronological continuity**, including who did what, where, and why.
3. **Includes all key discoveries**, magical items, environmental cues, rituals, emotional reactions, and major decisions.
4. **Uses immersive, elevated fantasy prose** -- never casual or modern.
5. **Depicts combat sequences, monster encounters, and boss battles with vivid, cinematic intensity**. Describe enemy forms, tactics, powers, damage taken, and how the party triumphed (or failed).
6. **Preserves character impact**: who took wounds, who made sacrifices, who cast crucial spells or delivered final blows. Show exhaustion, fear, or resolve when relevant.
7. **Concludes with a reflective or forward-looking insight**, thematically linking what has occurred to what lies ahead.
8. **Avoids generic phrasing** -- use specific names, textures, items, and visual language (e.g., "Norn's blade parted the specter's ribbed shadows" instead of "a character hit a ghost").
9. **Never omits quiet moments**: include tension-building silence, fog, haunted ambiance, or signs of dread -- even when no combat occurs.
10. **Narrate the complete journey through each location**: You MUST explicitly mention moving through or arriving at each location from the journey progression. Weave location names naturally into the narrative as the party travels through them.
11. **Captures the intimate human story**: As characters move through locations, chronicle their relationships. Did lovers steal a kiss in the shadowed alcove? Did companions share knowing glances across the battlefield? Use their nicknames and pet names—"Trouble Magnet" not just "the cleric." Show the tender touch that healed more than wounds, the playful banter that lightened dark moments, the jealous glare when affections wandered. These moments are as vital as any treasure found.
12. **Weaves in character details**: Include personal quirks and habits—how someone always checks their weapon thrice, needs three cups of tea to be civil, sleeps curled around their pack, or unconsciously reaches for their companion's hand in darkness. Show their fears (claustrophobia in dungeons?), desires (that longing look at soft beds), and intimate preferences.
13. **Chronicles both heat and tenderness**: When passion ignites—the desperate embrace after near-death, hands tangling in hair, armor clattering to stone—capture it fully. When comfort is offered—the cloak shared against cold, the wordless vigil by a sickbed, the gentle cleaning of wounds—honor it. The way bodies betray emotions: nervous tics, bitten lips, tell-tale blushes. Both fire and gentleness forge unbreakable bonds.

REQUIRED JOURNEY PROGRESSION (all locations must appear in your narrative):
Starting at: {start_loc}
Traveling through (in order): {' -> '.join(intermediate_locs)}
Ending at: {end_loc}

You MUST narrate the party's movement through EACH of these {len(intermediate_locs) + 2} locations in sequence.

Here is the input:

{conversation_text}

**The Golden Rule: Names Are Memory, Details Are Soul**
Before you begin, scan the entire conversation for:
- Every nickname, pet name, or term of endearment used
- Personal preferences (favorite drinks, foods, colors)
- Behavioral quirks and habits
- Fears, phobias, desires, and dreams
- How characters physically interact with each other
- Inside jokes and running gags

Then weave ALL of these throughout your chronicle. When you write "Eirik moved forward," you have failed if somewhere he was called "Trouble Magnet." When describing a rest, you have failed if you don't mention someone's tea ritual or how they always sleep with one eye open.

CRITICAL: Your narrative must include all location names from the journey progression above. Each location should appear naturally within the story as the party progresses through them. More importantly, show how each location affected the relationships—did the dark dungeon bring them closer? Did the open road allow playful teasing? Did danger spark passion?

Your output should read like a published game codex, narrative recap, or campaign journal entry written by a bard who was intimate with the party's secrets. Never reference this prompt or the data format -- just write the immersive chronicle that shows both the party's journey through every listed location AND the evolution of their bonds."""
