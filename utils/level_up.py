- If they gain spell slots, which spells do they want to prepare?
- If they gain a feat or ability score improvement, what do they choose?
- Any other class-specific choices

Once all decisions are made, use the updateCharacterInfo action to apply ALL changes at once. Include:
- Set level to {new_level}
- Update hit points and max hit points based on their choice
- Set experience_points to 0
- Set exp_required_for_next_level based on the leveling table
- Add any new class features
- Update spell slots if applicable
- Apply any other changes

Remember to explain each new feature they gain!"""

For this NPC level up:
1. Calculate HP increase (always take average + CON modifier)
2. List all new class features gained
3. Update spell slots if applicable
4. Determine new experience requirement for next level

Respond with ONLY a JSON object containing the changes to apply. Do not include unchanged fields.
The response must be a valid JSON object with these changes:
- level: {new_level}
- hitPoints: (new value)
- maxHitPoints: (new value)  
- experience_points: 0
- exp_required_for_next_level: (from leveling table)
- classFeatures: (array of new features to ADD, not replace)
- Any other fields that change
