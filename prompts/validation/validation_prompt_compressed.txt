  corrector: Guide to established content; maintain continuity
  validator: Ensure actions execute; check compliance with input

  5:spell_slot_validation: Cantrips=no slots; leveled=reduce slots

  rule: NEVER use location IDs (like L03, V05, B01) in narration - always use descriptive location names
  CRITICAL: If Path Validation says "VALID PATH FOUND", the path IS valid - accept the transitionLocation
